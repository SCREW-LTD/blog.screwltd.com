## Changes
- Added multiplayer from [<span style={{color: '#C39BD3'}}>Mirror SDK</span>](https://mirror-networking.com/)
- Vehicles now fit multiple players
- Added interactive actions with items
- Emote wheel added
- Opening doors and etc. of the car
- Added server console

Unfortunately, there are no official servers at the   
moment, but you can create your own!  
All you need is to download the server console from  
the game site, github or from your Steam library  

## Additional information
Based on our tests, it is best to run the server  
on a computer with components no worse than of:
```css
CPU : Ryzen 5 1600 / Core i3-9100
RAM : 12 GB
SSD : 32 GB
OS : Windows 11 / Linux Ubuntu 18.04
Stable internet speed at 25 Mbps
```  

    
Run your server only in <span style={{color: '#C39BD3'}}>Batchmode</span>!  
To configure your server, open the <span style={{color: '#C39BD3'}}>server.cfg</span> file.   
The server is running on <span style={{color: '#C39BD3'}}>96</span> tickrate.  
Maximum number of players: <span style={{color: '#C39BD3'}}>10000</span>.
